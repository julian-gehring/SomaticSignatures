# SomaticSignatures

The SomaticSignatures package identifies mutational signatures of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). It provides a infrastructure related to the methodology described in Nik-Zainal (2012, Cell), with flexibility in the matrix decomposition algorithms.

For details about usage, installation and methodology, please refer to the [`SomaticSignatures` package page in the Bioconductor repository](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SomaticSignatures/).
